# Encryption Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various encryption algorithms in Java. Encryption algorithms are essential tools for securing data and ensuring privacy in communication systems.

## Algorithms Included

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: A symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing sensitive data.
- **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**: An asymmetric encryption algorithm commonly used for secure data transmission and digital signatures.
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: A symmetric-key algorithm for encryption of electronic data.
- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: An algorithm for secure exchange of cryptographic keys over a public channel.

### Classic Encryption Algorithms
- **Caesar Cipher**: One of the earliest known substitution ciphers, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
- **Vigen√®re Cipher**: A method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.
- **Playfair Cipher**: A symmetric encryption technique that employs a 5x5 grid of letters for encryption and decryption.
- **Hill Cipher**: A polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra, where each letter is represented by a number and encrypted using matrix multiplication.

## Usage

Each algorithm has its implementation in a separate directory along with documentation on how to use it. Refer to the README files within each directory for detailed instructions on installation and usage.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have an implementation of an encryption algorithm in a programming language not already included, feel free to open a pull request.
